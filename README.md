Note: The dataset used in this project (simulated_zambia_tax_revenue.csv) is entirely simulated and does not represent actual figures from the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) or any government institution.

It was manually generated to reflect realistic trends and seasonal behaviors in tax revenue over time, for the sole purpose of demonstrating the capabilities of AI models like ARIMA and SARIMA in forecasting.

The methodology and tools used in this project can be applied to real revenue data upon availability and authorization.
